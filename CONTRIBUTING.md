# Welcome to The Radix Hub docs contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

Check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code ✨.

### Voting
Contributing to the community
If you are not into coding, you can always checkout the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/TheRadixHub/discussions), to see if there are any voting pools happening, or interact with everyone!

### Issues
Create a new issue
If you spot a bug within the plataform/protocol or a problem with the docs/code, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

### Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

## Make Changes
### Make changes in the UI
The main repo for the UI is here. While the protocol/project, has no liquidity/revenue, it will remain hosted by the GitHub Pages. As soon as there is a minimun enough amount to cover it's hosting, it will be moved to a decentralized hosting provider.

### Make changes in a network repo
Each network used/integrated with the project/protocol, has it's own repo and specific label for a pr. If a "x".network pr is made in the "y".network, it will be closed automatically.


### Make changes locally
Fork the main repository. But make sure to send your PR to the **test branch**!

- Using GitHub Desktop:

Getting started with GitHub Desktop will guide you through setting up Desktop.
Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!
Using the command line:

Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
Install or update to Node.js, at the version specified in .node-version. For more information, see the development guide.

Create a working branch and start with your changes!

Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to use the "Self review checklist" to speed up the review process ⚡.

### Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR. Directed to the **test branch**, in whatever repo you are working with.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.

Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the test repo, and subsequentialy, on main.
